## Current Task - 2026-06-21

- [x] Scope the full remaining `김사원세끼` source mapping work.
- [x] Make metadata-backed mapping safe to run for only `김사원세끼`.
- [x] Promote every restaurant with verified numeric Naver Map IDs.
- [x] Inspect and resolve any residual unmapped `김사원세끼` videos.
- [x] Verify DB mapping status, required Naver IDs, and app build.
- [x] Add the review result.

### Review

- Added source-scoped `김사원세끼` mapping support and safer parsing for numbered/bracket metadata.
- Promoted all Naver-ID-verifiable `김사원세끼` places: 280 videos are `mapping_verified`, 3 are `not_applicable`, 1 remains `mapping_pending` (`한일상회`, no verified Naver place ID), and 1 remains `mapping_partial` (`맛나분식`, no verified Naver place ID/address).
- Confirmed no restaurant has a blank `naver_map_id`, no public Naver place link is a search URL, and `pnpm run build` passes.
